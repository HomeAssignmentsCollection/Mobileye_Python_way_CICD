# Docker Best Practices Implementation

This document outlines the Docker best practices implemented in the Product Delivery Pipeline project.

## Overview

The Dockerfile has been completely rewritten to follow industry best practices for security, performance, and maintainability.

## Best Practices Applied

### 1. **Multi-Stage Builds**
- **Builder Stage**: Installs build dependencies and creates virtual environment
- **Production Stage**: Creates minimal runtime image with only necessary components
- **Benefit**: Reduces final image size by excluding build tools

### 2. **Security**
- **Non-Root User**: Container runs as `appuser` instead of root
- **Minimal Base Image**: Uses `python:3.9-slim` for smaller attack surface
- **Proper Permissions**: Files are owned by the non-root user
- **Benefit**: Reduces security vulnerabilities and follows principle of least privilege

### 3. **Layer Optimization**
- **Dependency Caching**: Requirements are copied and installed before application code
- **Combined RUN Commands**: Multiple commands in single RUN to reduce layers
- **Cleanup**: Removes package manager cache and temporary files
- **Benefit**: Faster builds and smaller images

### 4. **Environment Configuration**
- **Environment Variables**: Properly set Python and application environment
- **Build Arguments**: Use ARG for build-time configuration
- **Benefit**: Configurable builds and consistent runtime environment

### 5. **Dependency Management**
- **Separate Requirements**: `requirements-prod.txt` for production, `requirements.txt` for development
- **Version Pinning**: All dependencies have specific versions
- **Virtual Environment**: Uses Python venv for isolation
- **Benefit**: Reproducible builds and minimal production dependencies

### 6. **Metadata and Documentation**
- **Labels**: Comprehensive metadata for image identification
- **Comments**: Detailed explanations of each section
- **Benefit**: Better maintainability and compliance

### 7. **File Operations**
- **COPY vs ADD**: Uses COPY for simple file operations
- **Proper Ownership**: Files are copied with correct ownership
- **Working Directory**: Explicitly set working directory
- **Benefit**: Predictable file operations and security

## Dockerfile Structure

```dockerfile
# Build stage for dependencies
FROM python:3.9-slim AS builder
# ... build dependencies and virtual environment

# Production stage
FROM python:3.9-slim AS production
# ... runtime configuration and application
```

## Usage Examples

### Build the Image
```bash
make build
# or
docker build -t product-pipeline .
```

### Run the Pipeline
```bash
make docker-run
# or
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app product-pipeline python product_pipeline.py --repo_name ProductA
```

### Run Tests in Docker
```bash
make docker-test
# or
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app product-pipeline python -m pytest unit_test_PyTest/
```

### Development with Docker Compose
```bash
make docker-dev
# or
docker-compose up dev
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Never run containers as root** - Always use non-root users
2. **Keep base images updated** - Regularly update to latest security patches
3. **Scan images for vulnerabilities** - Use tools like Trivy or Snyk
4. **Use secrets management** - Never hardcode credentials in Dockerfiles
5. **Limit container capabilities** - Use security profiles when possible

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Multi-stage builds** reduce final image size
2. **Layer caching** speeds up rebuilds
3. **Minimal base images** reduce attack surface and size
4. **Proper cleanup** removes unnecessary files
5. **Virtual environments** isolate dependencies

## Monitoring and Debugging

1. **Logs**: Application logs are written to stdout/stderr
2. **Environment**: Use `docker exec` to inspect running containers
3. **Build**: Use `docker build --progress=plain` for detailed build output
4. **Inspection**: Use `docker inspect` to examine image metadata

## Best Practices Checklist

- [x] Use specific base image versions
- [x] Implement multi-stage builds
- [x] Use non-root user
- [x] Copy requirements first for caching
- [x] Combine RUN commands
- [x] Clean up package manager cache
- [x] Set proper environment variables
- [x] Use .dockerignore
- [x] Pin dependency versions
- [x] Use exec form for CMD
- [x] Add proper labels
- [x] Separate production and dev dependencies
- [x] Use COPY instead of ADD
- [x] Set proper working directory
- [x] Handle file permissions correctly
